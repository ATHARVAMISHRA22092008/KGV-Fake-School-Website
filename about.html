            </h1>
            <p>
                 King George V School Hong Kong is one of the best schools in the SAR of Hong Kong. We are very proud to be 
                 providing the best service to parents and childern since 1894 making us not only one of the best schools 
                but also the oldest school in Hong Kong. We strive to provide only the best so our campus includes over 
                10 buildings each mainly for a specific subject. Our motto is honestas ante honores which means that 
                glory comes only after honesty so we have a set of reasonable rules that students must follow. We are also
                very open to change and we hereby promise that we will try our best to change anything that you may not like
                about this school. We do not expect students to be the best in the world but rather it is much much better if
                students are the best they can be thus the saying: "Be Your Own Remarkable" Our current address is 2 kin tong 
                road Ho Man Tin, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR. We are proud members of ESF or the English Schools Foundation. We teach
                MYP(middle year programme) to yr 7-8, IGCSE, IB and Diploma. We are also part of the International Baccalaurete(IB).                    ensuring the best eduction for you or your child.
